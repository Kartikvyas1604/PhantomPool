# PhantomPool - Zero-Knowledge Dark Pool Trading Platform

A privacy-first decentralized exchange built on Solana that enables large traders to execute orders without revealing their trading intentions or positions to the market.

## What is PhantomPool?

PhantomPool solves the $2B+ monthly OTC trading problem by providing institutional-grade privacy for on-chain trades. Traditional DEXs expose all order information publicly, allowing MEV bots and front-runners to exploit large trades. Our solution uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep orders completely private until execution.

## Core Features

### üîí Complete Trade Privacy
- Orders encrypted with ElGamal homomorphic encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs ensure solvency without revealing balances
- VRF-based fair ordering prevents MEV attacks
- Threshold decryption across 5 executor nodes

### ‚ö° Optimal Execution
- Jupiter aggregator integration for best prices
- Batch auction mechanism with 30-second intervals
- Fair clearing price for all matched trades
- Atomic settlement prevents partial fills

### üõ°Ô∏è Trustless Security
- 3-of-5 threshold signatures for execution
- Bulletproofs+ for solvency verification
- Verifiable randomness for order shuffling
- On-chain settlement with full transparency

## How It Works

1. **Order Submission**: Traders submit encrypted orders with solvency proofs
2. **Private Matching**: Orders are shuffled using VRF and matched at fair clearing prices
3. **Threshold Decryption**: 3 of 5 executors must agree to decrypt matched orders
4. **Jupiter Execution**: Trades execute through optimal DEX routes
5. **Settlement**: All trades settle atomically on Solana
